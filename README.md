# VR-Project1

This project is about a web-based VR application that allows you to navigate through a decorated room and interact with select objects. The application is created using HTML, JavaScript and mainly using the AFrame web-framework. This project is accompolished for the purposes of the CS 5331 Virtual Reality Class(Fall 2020) at Texas Tech University.

In this project we show how COVID-19 impacted on your daily lives and the surrounding environment. This project consists of certain interactable objects which helps us to switch between normal to COVID Mode and the other actions as well.

## Introduction
_**A-Frame**_ is a web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. A-Frame is based on top of HTML, making it simple to get started. But A-Frame is not just a 3D scene graph or a markup language; the core is a powerful entity-component framework that provides a declarative, extensible, and composable structure to _**three.js**_.

A-Frame supports most VR headsets such as Vive, Rift, Windows Mixed Reality, Daydream, GearVR, Cardboard, Oculus Go, and can even be used for augmented reality. Although A-Frame supports the whole spectrum, A-Frame aims to define fully immersive interactive VR experiences that go beyond basic 360Â° content, making full use of positional tracking and controllers.

## Skillset/Technilogy Used:
The project is done using HTML document as it needed to be web-based. A combination of basic HTML tags and JS were used to create a small portion of this application. The main portion of the application was coded using the [A-Frame web framework](https://aframe.io). In addition, I also included the help of the [A-Frame Extras](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras) library to include the **look-controls** add-on to the camera component. Apart from these I also included _tap-to-teleport.js_ file in order to provide teleportation feature within the application. By the above it allows for the app to be accessible through a computer or a phone with/without a Google Cardboard. For interactivity of the objects I used "Aframe Animations" and used some scripting in JS.

This project was coded in the [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) IDE. WebStorm is very useful for developing these kind of applications because we don't need any live server in order to view the applications, we can simply run from the IDE. 

**Tip:** It's always better to use the models/objects with _low poly_ as they make your application to render quick.

## Conclusion
For this project, I designed a well-lit room that the user could navigate through and interact with select objects. The application is accessible through both a computer and phone; however, the computer navigation does have some small issues. Some obstacles were encountered when it came to warming up to the A-Frame and web development environments, but these issues were eventually eliminated. Overall, I completed a solid product that contains all the requirements to receive an excellent rating.
